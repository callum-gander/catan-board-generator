# Todo

- Figure out how to add the material to tiles after they've been added
- Decode and rewrite this placement algorithm https://github.com/andrewflynn/bettersettlers/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/nut/bettersettlers/logic/PlacementLogic.java
- Pick better colors? maybe actually add proper textures and additional geometry to them
- Get rid of the height issue
- Redesign the side bar and instructions
- Realistically, as long and difficult as it would be, updating this to use modern JS and build tools would be nice as I feel like the more I do, the more problems I'm going to run into. However, that also might as well be the last step as the only real reason to do that is if it becomes a PROPER project
